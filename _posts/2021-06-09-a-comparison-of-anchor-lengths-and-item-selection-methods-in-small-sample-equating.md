## Abstract
Two factors known to affect the quality of an equating anchor are length and item selection method. This simulation study considers the way in which both factors affect equating accuracy when samples are small. The following conditions were studied for a 100-item test: sample size (*N* = 10, 25, 50, 100), anchor length (*V* = 20, 25, 30, 35, 40), item selection method (minitest, semi-miditest, miditest), and equating method (identity, synthetic, nominal weights mean, circle-arc). Results showed that the minitest tended to produce the most accurate results, though the differences between item selection methods decreased as sample size increased. Additionally, the use of longer anchors generally improved results, especially for sample sizes of 10 and 25. Of the equating methods, synthetic equating was the most effective when the sample size was 10, while nominal weights mean equating or circle-arc equating were preferable for all other sample sizes.
