## Abstract
This study compares the effects of the multiple-choice (MC) and the discrete-option multiple-choice (DOMC) item formats on item preknowledge. Participants were randomly assigned to be either a Coach or a Beneficiary. Coaches were instructed to memorize as much of the item content as possible, and Beneficiaries were instructed to earn the highest score possible. Coaches were then split into two groups: those who experienced only MC items, and those who experienced only DOMC items. Once a Coach had completed the test, they were paired with a Beneficiary, whom they met with for 1 hour to discuss the test and the items they had seen. Then, the Coach was dismissed, and the Beneficiary was given the test where half of the items were compromised, and half were secure. Results showed statistically significant differences between the compromised item scores of the MC Beneficiaries and the DOMC Beneficiaries. The lower scores earned by the DOMC Beneficiaries may reflect the additional challenges faced by DOMC Coaches as they attempted to pass on item preknowledge.
