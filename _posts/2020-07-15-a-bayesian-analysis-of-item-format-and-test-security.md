## Abstract
This study uses real data to demonstrate that the discrete-option multiple-choice (DOMC) item format is a promising tool in combatting item preknowledge. After running a multiple linear regression and a Bayesian linear regression to predict compromised item score, item format repeatedly emerged as a significant predictor, as did secure item score. Those who experienced the test in the DOMC format and received low scores on the secure items were less likely to benefit from item preknowledge, which was reflected by their lower compromised item scores. In addition, Bayesian model averaging was run on the full model to compute the probability that these coefficients were different than 0. For both item format and secure item score, high probabilities were returned. Thus, it is very likely that these variables are valid predictors of compromised item score, and the previously stated relationships are supported.
