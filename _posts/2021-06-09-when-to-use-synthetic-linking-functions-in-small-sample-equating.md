## Abstract
In small-sample equating, a synthetic linking function may be used to reduce random equating error. However, this benefit comes at a cost: an increase in bias when test forms differ in difficulty. This study aims to identify which, if any, situations are best handled by synthetic equating. Test forms were simulated to contain 100 total items, of which 30 items comprised the anchor. Four sample sizes were considered (*N* = 10, 25, 50, 100), and the difference in test form difficulties as well as the difference between group abilities were treated as random to encompass a variety of situations. Results indicate that synthetic
equating may be preferable when the sample size is 25 or smaller and when it is known that the test forms do not differ markedly in difficulty. In all other cases, however, it is recommended that traditional equating functions be used.
