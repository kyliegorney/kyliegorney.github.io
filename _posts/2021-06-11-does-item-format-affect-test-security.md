## Abstract
Unlike the traditional multiple-choice (MC) format, the discrete-option multiple-choice (DOMC) format does not necessarily reveal all answer options to an examinee. The purpose of this research was to determine whether the reduced exposure of item content affects test security. To do so, participants were provided with study guides containing item information prior to taking a test. The test contained secure and compromised items, and it was divided equally into DOMC and MC halves. Results showed nearly identical score gains for both item formats when items were compromised. However, the DOMC cheating ability estimates displayed less error overall, and they were more highly correlated with the true ability estimates. Thus, for this particular study, the DOMC format did offer a slight advantage in the presence of item preknowledge.
