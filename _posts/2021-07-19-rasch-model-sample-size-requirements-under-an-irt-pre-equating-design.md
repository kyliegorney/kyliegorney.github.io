## Abstract
In an embedded pretesting design, pretest items are incorporated into the operational test such that the examinees do not know which items are scored and which are unscored. In item response theory (IRT) pre-equating, item parameter estimates obtained from previous administrations are used to score examinees in the current administration. In particular, these estimates may have been obtained back when the items were pretested. Thus, it is crucial that the pretest item parameter estimates are accurate, else future ability parameter estimates and test scores may be biased. Much of the research conducted on IRT pre-equating with an embedded pretesting design has focused on the 3PL model. However, the Rasch model requires fewer examinees for adequate calibration, thereby allowing a higher volume of items to be pretested at once. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimum sample size needed to produce accurate item parameter estimates, and in turn, accurate ability parameter estimates, under an IRT pre-equating design using the Rasch model. We examined real and simulated data gathered from a single administration of a licensure exam. Five test forms were administered, each comprised of 50 common (scored) items and 10 unique (pretest) items. Seven sample sizes (*N* = 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000) were considered and drawn from each test form. Results showed that sample sizes as small as 400 examinees were able to produce accurate item and ability parameter estimates, and the addition of any examinees beyond this point resulted in negligible improvement.
