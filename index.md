I am a third-year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am pursuing a Ph.D. in <a href="https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/" target="_blank">Educational Psychology (Quantitative Methods)</a> and am working with Dr. James Wollack. My primary research interests include test security, item response theory, and latent variable models. Currently, I am serving as a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.ncbex.org/" target="_blank">National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE)</a>.
